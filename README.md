Project Title: Population Genetics Web Tool
Description:
This GitHub repository hosts the source code for a web-based software tool developed as part of the MSC Bioinformatics Software Development Group Project 2024. The project's primary objective is to create a functional prototype for handling molecular biology data, with a specific focus on human population genetics.

Key Features:
Clustering Analysis: This web application performs clustering analysis on the provided genetic data, allowing users to select specific populations or superpopulations for analysis.

Admixture Analysis: It also offers admixture analysis, enabling users to choose populations or superpopulations for analysis.

Genetic Information Retrieval: Users can retrieve sample allele and genotype frequencies, as well as clinical relevance information for SNPs of interest, based on SNP IDs, genomic coordinates, or gene names. The choice of populations for this analysis is customizable.

Pairwise Population Genetic Differentiation: When multiple populations are selected, the application generates a matrix of pairwise population genetic differentiation and provides a suitable visual representation. Users can also download the results as a text file.

Informative Plots and Visualizations: Results and illustrations are presented in a manner that aids in answering biological questions related to population genetics.

Project Timeline:
Project Start Date: Monday, 22nd January
Project End Date: Friday, 1st March
Technologies Used:
SQL for database management
Various clustering and admixture analysis techniques
Data retrieval from external sources (1000 Genomes Project, UCSC, Ensembl, GWAS Catalog)
Web-based front-end for user interaction
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the project documentation.
Run the web application using your preferred development environment.
Follow the user interface to perform clustering, admixture analysis, and retrieve genetic information.
