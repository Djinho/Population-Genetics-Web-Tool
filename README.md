# Population Genetics Web Tool

This GitHub repository hosts the source code for a web-based software tool developed as part of the MSC Bioinformatics Software Development Group Project 2024. The project's primary objective is to create a functional prototype for handling molecular biology data, with a specific focus on human population genetics.

## Project Overview

The application facilitates the analysis of genetic data collected from a Siberian population, integrated with data from the 1000 Genomes Project, to explore population structure and genetic admixture. It enables clustering analysis, admixture analysis, allele and genotype frequencies retrieval for SNPs, and comparison of genetic differentiation across populations.

## System Architecture

### Backend

- **Flask Application:** Handles routing, session management, and communication between the frontend and the database.
- **SQLite Database:** Stores genetic data, population information, and SNP annotations for efficient querying.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Utilizes NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for generating plots and interactive visualizations.
- **Session Management:** Managed by Flask-Session to ensure data persistence across different views and analyses.

### Frontend

- **HTML/CSS:** Uses HTML templates and CSS for a consistent UI, focusing on the 'Bebas Neue' font and a cohesive color scheme.
- **JavaScript:** Enables interactive elements and dynamic content loading, handling form inputs, and rendering Plotly charts.

## Key Features

- **Clustering Analysis:** Allows users to select specific populations for analysis.
- **Admixture Analysis:** Users can choose populations for admixture analysis.
- **Genetic Information Retrieval:** Retrieves allele and genotype frequencies, and clinical relevance for SNPs, customizable by populations.
- **Pairwise Population Genetic Differentiation:** Generates a matrix of differentiation and visual representation, with results downloadable as a text file.

## Data Management and Analysis

The workflow includes data import and storage into SQLite, clustering and admixture analysis, and SNP information retrieval, integrating SNP clinical relevance and population information.

## Security and Accessibility

Emphasizes input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks, adhering to web standards for broad compatibility.

## User Guide and Tutorials

The `tutorials.html` page offers guides on analyses, interpreting results, and navigating the application, designed to make the tool accessible to users unfamiliar with population genetics.

## Technologies Used

- Flask for web application development
- SQLite for database management
- NumPy, Pandas for data analysis
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualizations
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend

## Deployment and Future Work

The prototype is intended for demonstration, with future enhancements focused on optimizing performance, security, and expanding the dataset.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the project documentation.
3. Run the application using your preferred development environment.
4. Use the UI to perform clustering, admixture analysis, and retrieve genetic information.
