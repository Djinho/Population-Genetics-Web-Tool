  <h2>Admixture Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Admixture analysis is used to infer the ancestry of individuals by determining the proportion of an individual's ancestry that comes from each of several potential source populations. This can provide insights into the historical migrations and mixtures of populations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This analysis can be crucial for understanding the genetic structure of populations and for studying the genetic basis of diseases. By identifying the ancestral proportions in an individual's genome, researchers can better account for genetic variation in association studies.
