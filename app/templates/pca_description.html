    <br>
    <p>
        Principle Component Analysis, also known as PCA, is used for large datasets as a dimensionality reduction method. This is done by transformation of potentially correlated variables into a set with a much smaller size that still retain the original information. It also helps to eliminate or minimise the chances of multicollinearity and overfitting [1]. The key feature of PCA is that it can be used to project sample data onto orthogonal axes comprised of linear combinations or genotypic or allelic values across SNPs. This is chosen so the first principle component can be used to explain the greatest variance amongst the whole data [2].

    <p>
        In population genetics, it can be used to identify ancestry differences between populations and samples, irrespective of any historical patterns in the structure. Population stratification, the differences between allele frequencies that can lead to incorrect associations in disease studies, can be overcome by the use of PCA [3].

    <p>
        Using genotype data to conduct PCA to capture structures of populations involves multiple steps. This includes removal of related individuals, and excluding outlier samples which could imply distant relatedness or poor genotyping quality. Additionally, some analyses could require restriction to individuals of homogenous ancestry [4].
